Parks and other forms of open spaces consitute more than 40% of the land area and are strategically located so that residents do not have to walk more than one block to access them.

The linear park system, including the nature reserve, along the southern boundary is a major attraction that not only unifies different neighborhoods, but also provides great recreational opportunities for the residents and the surrounding neighborhoods.

The environmental features such as bio-swales, rain gardens, heavily planted “green” streets, LEED certified community buildings, usable roof gardens and environtment-sensitive residential architecture creates unique “branding” for this community.

Investment Strategies: 

Locate land uses compatible with adjacent developments

Extend network of streets to physically link surrounding communities

Dedicate land area to accommodate the Corridor Cities Transitway/ hiker-biker trail system

Public Benefits: 

Better integration of surrounding neighborhoods

Enhanced access to new neighborhood services, education, and transit

Expanded recreational and educational opportunities

Environmental Benefits: 

Reduced circuitious travel routes - more direct access encourages pedestrican and bicycle traffic

Urban Ecosystem where natural habitat coexists with the human habitat
